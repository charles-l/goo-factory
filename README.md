# Raylib WASM
A Template for making Odin, Raylib, and WASM (Emscripten) projects

## Features
* Works well in Windows (It probably also works for the other desktop platforms but I didn't test it)
* Logging on WASM Works!

## What won't work
* Most of Core Libraries (fmt, os, time, etc.)

## Building

### Windows
```batch
.\build.bat
```

### WASM

#### Requirements
1. [emsdk](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html)

> [!NOTE]  
> In `build_web.bat`, you need to modify the path to where your `emsdk_env.bat` is located

```batch
.\build_web.bat

:: For running
cd build_web
python -m http.server
```
